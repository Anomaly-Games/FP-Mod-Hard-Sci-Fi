# FP-Mod-Hard-Sci-Fi

This is a developer mod for the narrative strategy god sim "The Fermi Paradox"

https://fermi-paradox.com/

The original game includes sci fi tropes like Faster than Light Travel, Wormholes and we plan even more quite unscientific stuff in futher updates. Some would like to have a game about the Fermi Paradox more grounded, so this mod caps the highest Tech Level at the Singularity Age. 

If we expand the modding setup it would be sweet to even change the "Final Technolgy" ending from an Ansible to something more scientific.
